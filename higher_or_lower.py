# ============================================================
# HIGHER/LOWER GAME LOGIC EXPLANATION
# ============================================================
# 1. The game uses a dataset "data", which is a list of dictionaries.
#    Each dictionary represents a person with keys:
#      'name', 'follower_count', 'description', 'country'.
#
# 2. Functions choose_a() and choose_b() pick a random person from the data
#    and print their info (name, description, country).
#    NOTE: follower counts inside these functions are currently local,
#          so comparisons outside the functions will not work correctly.
#
# 3. The main game loop logic should be:
#    - Show A and B to the user
#    - Ask who has more followers
#    - Check if the user's guess is correct
#    - If correct:
#        - increment score
#        - shift B to A
#        - pick a new B
#    - Repeat until the user guesses incorrectly
#
# 4. CURRENT ISSUES/BUGS:
#    - a_follower_count and b_follower_count inside choose_a()/choose_b()
#      are local, so the comparison in the main loop does not work.
#    - Every call to choose_a() or choose_b() picks a new random person,
#      so names may not match the follower counts being compared.
#    - The same person can appear as both A and B, which should not happen.
#    - Updating A and B after a correct guess is not implemented yet.
#    - Only the first round works properly; no continuous loop for multiple rounds.
#    - If the first guess is wrong, the game ends immediately.
#    - Input handling is minimal: currently only using .lower() for 'A'/'B'.
#
# 5. SUGGESTED FIXES:
#    - Store selected A and B globally or return them from functions.
#    - Only pick a new B after a correct guess, and shift old B to A.
#    - Ensure A and B are never the same person.
#    - Implement a proper while loop until game_over = True.
#    - Keep follower counts consistent with the displayed names.
#    - Optionally, improve input validation for user guesses.
